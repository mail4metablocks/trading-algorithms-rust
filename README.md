# Trading algorithms in Rust

Traders use trading algorithms to execute trades in a systematic and automated manner, which can help to remove the emotions and subjectivity from the trading process. Trading algorithms can be used in a variety of contexts, including high-frequency trading, statistical arbitrage, and other forms of automated trading.

There are many different types of trading algorithms, including:

    Trend-following algorithms: These algorithms are designed to identify and follow trends in financial markets.

    Mean-reversion algorithms: These algorithms are designed to identify situations where the price of a financial instrument has moved away from its historical average and to trade in a way that profits from the eventual return to that average.

    Arbitrage algorithms: These algorithms are designed to identify and exploit price discrepancies between different financial instruments or markets.

    Portfolio optimization algorithms: These algorithms are designed to optimize the composition of a portfolio of financial instruments in order to maximize returns or minimize risk.

    Risk management algorithms: These algorithms are designed to help traders manage risk by setting limits on the size of positions and the level of exposure to different financial instruments.
